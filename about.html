        Hello! I'm Matt Zwerlein, a Front End Web Developer who graduated from
        Waukesha County Technical College (WCTC). My background consists of a
        wide range of customer service jobs primarily in the restaurant
        industry, with some time spent in IT support.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-8">
        Since first getting into Web Development at WCTC, I have developed an
        interest in the React library and have also started working with NextJS.
        I'm very much looking forward to expanding my knowledge in this field,
        both in design and coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of React, my skills include languages and frameworks like PHP,
        WordPress, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, tools such as Docker and Git,
        and design applications like Figma and Adobe XD
      </p>
